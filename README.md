Welcome to the tundra_shrub_expansion repository, part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository serves as the central hub for our research at ESIIL, hosting the project description, proposals, bio, codebase, and more.

## Project Summary

Woody encroachment, driven by climate warming, disturbance, and altered nutrient cycling, is occurring across ecosystems globally with significant implications for surface energy balance and ecosystem functions and services. These vegetation shifts modify biogeochemical and biophysical processes locally, altering ecosystem energy, water, and carbon (C) fluxes. While there is widespread agreement that woody encroachment has regional and global consequences that can create non-linear climate feedbacks, the underlying biological processes are poorly incorporated into land models that are used for climate change projections. 

Two related challenges must be addressed to incorporate shrub encroachment into land models. First, studies using modeling approaches to explore shrub encroachment have largely assumed arbitrary increases in cover, demonstrating a need for predictive tools to understand the mechanisms driving these transitions. Second, land models have largely overlooked trait-environmental relationships even though plant traits vary with environmental conditions and trait differences between encroaching shrubs and resident species are likely critical in shaping ecosystem responses and climate feedbacks. By leveraging big datasets in combination with remote sensing techniques, machine learning approaches, and process-based ecosystem modeling, my project will tackle these challenges and increase our ability to incorporate vegetation dynamics into regional and global land model predictions. I will integrate diverse, open datasets at local and regional scales to quantify woody encroachment rates while helping to develop a pipeline for using these datasets in ecological studies with land models in other ecosystems.

## Customize Your Repository

As a new working group, you'll want to make this repository your own. Here's how to get started:

1. **Edit This Readme**: Replace the placeholder content with information about your specific project. Ensure that the introduction, project overview, and objectives clearly reflect your group's research focus.

2. **Update Bio**: Add details about your expertise, role in the project, and professional background. Include links to personal or professional web pages to foster community engagement and collaboration.

3. **Organize Your Code**: Structure your codebase in a way that is logical and accessible. Use directories and clear naming conventions to make it easy for all members to find and contribute to different parts of the project.

4. **Document Your Data**: Include a data directory with README files explaining the datasets, sources, and any preprocessing steps. This will help new members understand and work with the project's data effectively.

5. **Outline Your Methods**: Create a detailed METHODS.md file where you describe the methodologies, software, and tools you will be using in your research. This transparency will support reproducibility and collaborative development.

6. **Set Up Project Management**: Utilize the 'Issues' and 'Projects' features on GitHub to track tasks, discuss ideas, and manage your workflow. This can help in maintaining a clear view of progress and priorities.

7. **Add a License**: Choose and include an appropriate open-source license for your project, ensuring that the broader community understands how they can use and contribute to your work.

8. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Establish a CONTRIBUTING.md file with instructions for members on how to propose changes, submit issues, and contribute code.

9. **Review and Merge Workflow**: Decide on a workflow for reviewing and merging changes. Will you use branch protection? Who will have merge privileges? Document this process to avoid confusion.

10. **Establish Communication Channels**: Beyond GitHub, set up additional communication channels like Slack, Discord, or email lists for quick and informal discussions.

Remember, the goal is to make your repository clear, accessible, and useful for all current and future members of your working group. Happy researching!
